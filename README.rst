Puppetboard
###########

Puppetboard is a web interface to `PuppetDB`_ aiming to replace the reporting
functionality of `Puppet Dashboard`_.

Puppetboard relies on the `pypuppetdb`_ library to fetch data from PuppetDB
and is built with the help of the `Flask`_ microframework.

.. _pypuppetdb: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypuppetdb
.. _PuppetDB: http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppetdb/latest/index.html
.. _Puppet Dashboard: http://docs.puppetlabs.com/dashboard/
.. _Flask: http://flask.pocoo.org

Because this project is powered by Flask we are restricted to:
    * Python 2.6
    * Python 2.7

Word of caution
===============

Puppetboard is very, very young but it works fairly well.

That being said a lot of the code is very exeprimental, just trying
to figure out what works and what not, what we need to do different
and what features we need on the PuppetDB side of things.

As such you should be at least comfortable handling a few errors
this might throw at you.

Installation
============

Currently you can only run from source:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git clone https://github.com/nedap/puppetboard
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install all the requirements for Puppetboard.

Run it
======

Development
-----------

You can run in it in development mode by simple executing:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python dev.py

Production
----------
For WSGI capable webservers a ``wsgi.py`` is provided which ``mod_wsgi``
and ``uwsgi`` can deal with.

  * Apache mod_wsgi configuration: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/deploying/mod_wsgi/
  * uwsgi configuration: ``uwsgi --http :9090 --wsgi-file /path/to/puppetboard/wsgi.py``

In the case of uwsgi you'll of course need something like nginx in front of it to
proxy the requests to it.

Don't forget that you also need to serve the ``static/`` folder on the
``/static`` URL of your vhost. (I'm considering embedding the little additional
Javascript and CSS this application has so no one has to bother with that).

Configuration
=============

Puppetboard has some configuration settings, their defaults can
be viewed in ``puppetboard/default_settings.py``.

Additionally Puppetboard will look for an environment variable
called ``PUPPETBOARD_SETTINGS`` pointing to a file with identical
markup as ``default_settings.py``. Any setting defined in
``PUPPETBOARD_SETTINGS`` will override the defaults.

Experimental
------------
Pypuppetdb and Puppetboard can query and display information from
PuppetDB's experimental API endpoints.

However, if you haven't enabled them for Puppet it isn't particularily
useful to enable them here as there will be no data to retrieve.

Third party
===========
Some people have already started building things with and around Puppetboard.

`Hunter Haugen`_ has provided a Vagrant setup:

* https://github.com/hunner/puppetboard-vagrant

`Spencer Krum`_ created a Puppet module to install Puppetboard with:

* https://github.com/nibalizer/puppet-module-puppetboard

You can install it with:

    puppet module install nibalizer-puppetboard

The preferred format of a commit message:

::

    docs/quickstart: Fixed a typo in the Nodes section.

    If needed, elaborate further on this commit. Feel free to write a
    complete blog post here if that helps us understand what this is
